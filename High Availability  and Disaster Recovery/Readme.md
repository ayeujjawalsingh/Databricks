## ✅ High Availability (HA) in Databricks

### 🔹 What is High Availability (HA)?

High Availability ensures that your Databricks services remain **accessible and operational** even in the event of component failures (e.g., node crash, zone outage).

### 🔹 Components that support HA in Databricks:

| Component                       | HA Mechanism                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Control Plane**               | Managed by Databricks (resides in Databricks' own AWS/Azure/GCP account). It is inherently HA, backed by cloud-native tools. |
| **Data Plane**                  | Deployed in your cloud account (your AWS/Azure/GCP). HA here depends on how you've set up the cluster and data storage.      |
| **Clusters (Jobs/All-purpose)** | Auto-healing, multi-zone support (based on cloud setup), and worker node restarts                                            |
| **Databricks Workspace**        | Backed by HA cloud services (like S3/ADLS, Azure Key Vault, etc.)                                                            |

> 💡 **Note:** For mission-critical workloads, use **multi-node clusters** and **multi-zone deployments** in your cloud.

## 🚨 Disaster Recovery (DR) in Databricks

### 🔹 What is Disaster Recovery (DR)?

DR is about preparing for **unexpected failures**—like region-level outages or accidental data loss—and having a **plan to restore** operations and data quickly.

---

### 🔹 Key DR Strategies for Databricks

| Component                    | DR Strategy                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Notebooks & Repos**        | Use **Git integration** (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) to version control notebooks.                  |
| **Workflows (Jobs)**         | Export job JSON configurations using REST API or Terraform to back them up.                      |
| **Clusters & Pools**         | Save configuration as JSON or use IaC (Terraform).                                               |
| **Delta Tables**             | Enable **Delta Lake Time Travel** and configure **cross-region backups** (e.g., S3 replication). |
| **Unity Catalog Metastore**  | Backed by Databricks; use **metastore export scripts** for backups.                              |
| **Secrets**                  | Store externally in a secure key management system like Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.  |
| **Init Scripts & Libraries** | Store in version-controlled blob storage (e.g., S3, ADLS) with replication enabled.              |

### 🔸 DR Levels of Readiness

| Readiness Level | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cold DR**     | Manual backup & restore, longer RTO/RPO             |
| **Warm DR**     | Semi-automated sync, moderate recovery time         |
| **Hot DR**      | Fully automated failover and sync; minimal downtime |

## 🔄 Databricks Sync Tool

### 🔹 What is the Sync Tool?

The **Databricks Sync Tool** is a CLI utility that **replicates resources** (like notebooks, jobs, clusters, and other metadata) from one workspace (source) to another (target). It's helpful in setting up **DR environments**, **workspace migration**, or **multi-region setups**.

---

### 🔹 Key Features

* Sync Notebooks, Jobs, Clusters, Pools
* Supports dry-run and actual sync
* Maintains folder structure
* Ideal for **workspace-to-workspace backup**, **replication**, and **promotion**

---

### 🔹 When to Use

* **Setting up Disaster Recovery** (across regions/accounts)
* **Creating Dev → QA → Prod pipelines**
* **Cross-region deployments**

---

### 🔹 Supported Resources

| Resource      | Support                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Workspaces    | ✅                                 |
| Notebooks     | ✅                                 |
| Clusters      | ✅                                 |
| Jobs          | ✅                                 |
| Pools         | ✅                                 |
| Secrets       | ❌ (Must be managed externally)    |
| Tables / Data | ❌ (Use data replication for this) |

---

### 🔹 How It Works (Simple Flow)

```shell
# Example CLI Command
databricks-sync \
  --source <source-workspace-url> \
  --target <target-workspace-url> \
  --resources notebooks,jobs,clusters \
  --dry-run
```

* Authenticates using **PAT (Personal Access Token)** or **OAuth**
* Reads resources from source workspace
* Writes them to target workspace, preserving structure
* Can operate in **dry-run mode** to show what will change

---

### 🔹 Best Practices

* Always use **dry-run** first before syncing.
* Automate syncs using **CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)**.
* Maintain **version control** of synced assets (especially notebooks/jobs).
* Use tagging/labels to differentiate DR environments.

## 🔐 HA/DR for Data Storage

| Storage            | HA Support                  | DR Strategy                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **S3/ADLS/GS**     | Multi-AZ (by default)       | Enable **cross-region replication**        |
| **Delta Lake**     | Yes (auto transaction logs) | Use **Time Travel** + **Snapshot backups** |
| **Hive Metastore** | Can be externalized         | Backup MySQL/Postgres regularly            |
| **Unity Catalog**  | Centralized & managed       | Use export scripts for DR setup            |

---

## 📌 Summary

| Aspect              | Recommendation                                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HA Setup**        | Use multi-node, multi-zone clusters; externalize secrets |
| **DR Strategy**     | Define RTO & RPO; replicate critical metadata & data     |
| **Sync Tool**       | Use for workspace backup/restore, environment cloning    |
| **Data Backups**    | Enable object storage versioning & replication           |
| **Version Control** | Git integration is **must-have** for notebooks & jobs    |
