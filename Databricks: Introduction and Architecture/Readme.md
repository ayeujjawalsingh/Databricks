# 📘 Databricks: Introduction and Architecture

## 🧠 What is Databricks?

Databricks is a **cloud-based platform** built for working with **big data**, **machine learning**, and **analytics**. It gives you everything in one place: notebooks for writing code, clusters to run your code, and tools for scheduling jobs, managing data, and working with teams.

It is built on **Apache Spark**, which is a powerful engine to process large-scale data quickly.

## 🏗️ Databricks Architecture Overview

Databricks is made up of **two main parts**:

### 1. 🧭 Control Plane (Managed by Databricks)

* Hosted in **Databricks’ own cloud account**
* Handles:

  * User interface (UI)
  * Notebooks
  * Job scheduler
  * REST APIs
  * Metadata about clusters and jobs
* **Does not have access to your actual data**

### 2. ⚙️ Data Plane (Runs in Your Cloud Account)

* Where your **compute resources (clusters)** run
* Accesses your **cloud storage (like S3, ADLS, or GCS)**
* Runs your:

  * ETL code
  * ML pipelines
  * SQL queries
* Your **data never leaves your cloud** – it's processed securely in your account

---

## 🔁 How Control Plane and Data Plane Work Together

* You use the **UI or APIs** in the **control plane** to:

  * Create clusters
  * Run notebooks
  * Schedule jobs
* The **control plane tells the data plane what to do**
* The **data plane does the actual work**: reads data, runs your code, and stores results

## 🧱 Core Components in Databricks

### 🔹 Clusters

* A **group of virtual machines** (VMs)
* Used to **run Spark code**
* Can be:

  * **Interactive**: for notebooks
  * **Job clusters**: for scheduled jobs
* Can auto-scale up/down as needed

---

### 📓 Notebooks

* Interactive coding environments
* Support **Python, SQL, Scala, and R**
* Useful for:

  * Data exploration
  * Building ETL pipelines
  * Training ML models
* Can be shared and commented on by team members

---

### 📅 Jobs

* Used to **run notebooks or scripts automatically**
* You can create **multi-task workflows**

  * Example: Ingest → Clean → Train → Export
* Supports:

  * Retry policies
  * Alerts
  * Parameter passing

---

### 🏢 SQL Warehouses

* Special compute engine used for **running SQL queries**
* Optimized for **BI dashboards** (Power BI, Tableau)
* Auto-start and auto-scale
* Works with **Databricks SQL Editor**

---

### 💾 Delta Lake

* Storage layer built on top of Parquet
* Brings **database features to data lakes**
* Supports:

  * **ACID Transactions**
  * **Schema evolution**
  * **Time travel** (versioned data)
  * **Streaming + Batch** processing
* File format: `.delta`

---

### 🔐 Unity Catalog

* Central tool for **managing permissions and governance**
* You can:

  * Assign roles to users/groups
  * Control access to tables, columns, and rows
  * See data lineage (where data came from)
  * Audit data usage
* Works across **multiple workspaces and clouds**
