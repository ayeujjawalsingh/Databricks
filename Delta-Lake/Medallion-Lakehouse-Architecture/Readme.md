# 🏗️ Medallion Lakehouse Architecture in Delta Lake (Databricks)

The **Medallion Architecture** is a foundational design pattern used in **Delta Lake** on **Databricks** to manage data pipelines effectively by organizing data into layered zones: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**. This architecture improves data **quality, reliability, performance**, and **consumption** for analytics and machine learning.

## 🔎 What is Medallion Architecture?

Medallion Architecture is a **multi-layered approach** for building **data lakehouses**. Data is incrementally improved as it moves from one layer to the next:

- **Bronze Layer**: Ingested Raw Data
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and Validated Data
- **Gold Layer**: Aggregated, Business-Ready Data

This layered approach ensures **modularity**, **data quality**, and **scalability**, making it suitable for both **batch and streaming** data processing.

## 🧱 Architecture Layers

### 🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw / Ingested Data

> **Purpose**: Capture raw, unmodified data from source systems.

- ✅ Stores data **as-is** from the source (Kafka, APIs, files, RDBMS, etc.)
- ✅ Includes **duplicates, nulls, and inconsistencies**
- ✅ Used for **auditing**, **debugging**, and **replay**

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE bronze_customer_raw
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/mnt/bronze/customer'
AS
SELECT * FROM cloud_files('/mnt/landing-zone/', 'json');
```

---

### 🥈 Silver Layer – Cleaned / Enriched Data

> **Purpose**: Apply **data cleansing, transformations, joins**, and business logic.

* ✅ Removes **duplicates**, fixes **nulls**
* ✅ Applies **standardization** (e.g., datetime, formatting)
* ✅ Joins multiple datasets to create a **canonical model**
* ✅ Trusted, validated data for internal consumption

**Example**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE silver_customer
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/mnt/silver/customer'
AS
SELECT DISTINCT id, name, email, to_date(registration_date) AS reg_date
FROM bronze_customer_raw
WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### 🥇 Gold Layer – Aggregated / Business-Level Data

> **Purpose**: Deliver **analytics-ready datasets** for BI dashboards, reports, and ML models.

* ✅ Data is **aggregated, grouped, filtered** by business logic
* ✅ Follows **data modeling principles** (star/snowflake schema)
* ✅ Serves Power BI, Tableau, ML use cases

**Example**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE gold_customer_sales_summary
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/mnt/gold/sales_summary'
AS
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM silver_sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
