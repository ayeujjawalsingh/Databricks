# 🏆 Medallion Lakehouse Architecture

## 📖 Overview

Medallion Architecture is a **design pattern used in modern data lakehouses (like Delta Lake on Databricks)**.

It breaks the data pipeline into **three logical layers**:
- 🥉 Bronze → Raw data
- 🥈 Silver → Cleaned data
- 🥇 Gold → Business-level data

This helps **organize big data pipelines**, **improve quality**, and **enable reuse**.

## 🏗️ Layers of Medallion Architecture

---

### 🥉 Bronze Layer – "Raw Data" (Ingestion Layer)

#### ✅ What it stores:
- Raw data directly from source systems (APIs, Kafka, RDBMS, files).
- Uncleaned and unprocessed.
- Often in formats like JSON, CSV, Parquet.

#### ✅ Purpose:
- Safely store data for audit/replay.
- Act as a backup or source of truth.
- Retain original data format and structure.

#### ✅ Example Code (Delta Table in Databricks):
```sql
CREATE TABLE bronze.raw_orders
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/mnt/bronze/raw_orders'
```

#### ✅ Tools used:

* Spark Structured Streaming / Auto Loader
* Airflow / Databricks Workflows for scheduling

---

### 🥈 Silver Layer – "Cleaned Data" (Refined Layer)

#### ✅ What it stores:

* Data after cleaning and transformation:

  * Remove duplicates
  * Fix formats (like timestamps)
  * Join with reference data
* Ready for analytics or further processing

#### ✅ Purpose:

* Improve data quality
* Apply basic business logic
* Ensure schema consistency

#### ✅ Example Code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE silver.cleaned_orders AS
SELECT 
  order_id,
  user_id,
  CAST(order_time AS TIMESTAMP) AS order_ts,
  amount
FROM bronze.raw_orders
WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL
```

---

### 🥇 Gold Layer – "Business Data" (Aggregated Layer)

#### ✅ What it stores:

* Final curated data
* Aggregated and summarized for:

  * Business Intelligence (BI) tools
  * Reporting dashboards
  * Machine Learning pipelines

#### ✅ Purpose:

* Ready-to-use data for decision-making
* Easy to understand for business users
* Often includes KPIs and metrics

#### ✅ Example Code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE gold.daily_sales_summary AS
SELECT 
  DATE(order_ts) AS order_date,
  region,
  SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM silver.cleaned_orders
GROUP BY DATE(order_ts), region
```

## 👨‍💼 Who Manages Each Layer?

| Layer     | Owned By      | Responsibilities |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 🥉 Bronze | Data Engineer |                  |

* Ingest raw data
* Handle schema changes
* Store safely in Delta Lake / cloud storage |

\| 🥈 Silver | Data Engineer |

* Clean and transform data
* Validate data quality
* Join with dimension tables
  |

\| 🥇 Gold | Data Engineer + Data Analyst + ML Engineer |

* Build business metrics
* Feed BI dashboards
* Train ML models with curated data
  |

> ⚙️ Gold layer is **collaborative**: Engineers create it, Analysts and Scientists consume it.

| Layer  | Data                                           |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Bronze | Raw clickstream logs from app                  |
| Silver | Cleaned sessions and user activities           |
| Gold   | Funnel conversion report, daily revenue report |

## ✅ Benefits of Medallion Architecture

| Feature          | Why It’s Useful                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 Reusability   | Same silver data can serve multiple gold datasets        |
| 📊 Clarity       | Clean separation between raw, refined, and business data |
| 📈 Performance   | Aggregations only on clean data, faster queries          |
| 🧪 Data Quality  | Validations happen in each stage                         |
| 💡 Debuggability | Errors are isolated per layer                            |
| 📚 Versioning    | Easy rollback and audits with Delta Time Travel          |

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Store each layer in **separate folders or database schemas** (e.g., `bronze/`, `silver/`, `gold/`)
* Use **Delta Lake features** like:

  * Schema evolution
  * Time travel
  * Optimize + ZORDER
* Automate pipelines using:

  * **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**
  * **Airflow**
  * **Databricks Jobs**

---

## 🛠️ Tools Commonly Used

| Layer  | Common Tools                       |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Bronze | Spark, Autoloader, AWS Glue        |
| Silver | PySpark, SQL, Databricks Notebooks |
| Gold   | SQL, Power BI, Tableau, MLFlow     |

---

## 📌 Summary

* Medallion Architecture = **Bronze + Silver + Gold**
* It's a **structured, layered approach** to handle raw to business-level data
* Helps you build **scalable**, **clean**, and **collaborative** data pipelines
