# 📘 Delta Lake

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings **ACID transactions**, **scalability**, and **data reliability** to big data workloads. It runs on top of existing data lakes like **S3, ADLS, GCS**, and supports **Apache Spark** and **Databricks**.

## 📌 What is Delta Lake?

> Delta Lake is a **storage layer** that enables **ACID transactions**, **data versioning**, and **schema control** on top of cloud object stores (like S3, ADLS, GCS) using **Apache Parquet format**.

---

## ❓ Why Delta Lake?

| Problem in Traditional Data Lakes | How Delta Solves It |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| No ACID Transactions             | Full transactional support |
| No schema validation             | Enforces and evolves schema |
| Data corruption & duplicates     | Managed write conflicts |
| No data versioning               | Time Travel supported |
| Slow query performance           | Optimized reads via indexing and caching |

---

## 🏗️ Delta Architecture

1. **Data Layer**: Actual data stored as Parquet files.
2. **Transaction Log**: Maintains metadata and changes in `_delta_log/` folder.
3. **Execution Engine**: Works with Spark, Databricks, etc.

---

## ⭐ Key Features

- ✅ ACID Transactions
- 🔄 Time Travel
- 🛡️ Schema Enforcement
- 🔧 Schema Evolution
- 🔍 Data Auditing
- ⚡ Optimized Read/Write
- 🔀 Streaming + Batch unified

---

## 🔐 ACID Transactions Explained

| Property    | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Atomicity**   | All or nothing writes |
| **Consistency** | Always valid state |
| **Isolation**   | No interference in concurrent ops |
| **Durability**  | Data persists even after failure |

---

## 🕰️ Time Travel

You can access previous versions of a Delta Table.

```sql
-- By version number
SELECT * FROM table_name VERSION AS OF 10;

-- By timestamp
SELECT * FROM table_name TIMESTAMP AS OF '2025-06-28T00:00:00';
```

### ✅ Use Cases:

* Debugging
* Rollback
* Auditing
* Re-processing old logic

---

## 📁 Delta Log (`_delta_log`)

Each Delta table has a hidden folder `_delta_log/` containing:

* JSON files: Transaction history
* Checkpoint files: Compact summary of previous logs
* Used by Delta to support versioning, concurrency, and recovery

---

## 🛡️ Schema Enforcement & Evolution

### ➤ Schema Enforcement

Rejects writes with incorrect schema.

### ➤ Schema Evolution

Allows new columns (if enabled).

```python
df.write.option("mergeSchema", "true").format("delta").mode("append").save(path)
```

---

## 🔄 Operations in Delta Lake (DML)

### 🔹 Insert

```sql
INSERT INTO delta_table VALUES (1, 'Alice');
```

### 🔹 Update

```sql
UPDATE delta_table SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;
```

### 🔹 Delete

```sql
DELETE FROM delta_table WHERE id = 1;
```

### 🔹 Merge (Upsert)

```sql
MERGE INTO target t
USING source s
ON t.id = s.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *;
```

---

## 🧱 Delta Table Types

| Table Type   | Description                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Managed**  | Data and metadata managed by Databricks     |
| **External** | Data stored in external locations (S3/ADLS) |

```sql
-- External Table
CREATE TABLE my_table
USING DELTA
LOCATION 's3://bucket/path/';
```

---

## 🚀 Optimizations in Delta Lake

### 🔹 OPTIMIZE

Combines small files into large files for performance.

```sql
OPTIMIZE delta_table;
```

### 🔹 ZORDER

Reorders data to optimize filters on specific columns.

```sql
OPTIMIZE delta_table ZORDER BY (column1);
```

### 🔹 VACUUM

Removes old versions of data no longer needed.

```sql
VACUUM delta_table RETAIN 168 HOURS; -- 7 days
```

## 🆚 Delta Lake vs Traditional Data Lakes

| Feature             | Traditional Lake | Delta Lake    |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| File Format         | CSV/Parquet      | Parquet       |
| Transactions        | ❌                | ✅ ACID        |
| Schema Enforcement  | ❌                | ✅             |
| Versioning          | ❌                | ✅ Time Travel |
| Concurrency Support | ❌                | ✅             |
| Performance         | Medium           | High          |
