# 📘 Materialized Gold Tables

This guide explains **Materialized Gold Tables** in Delta Lake / Databricks — what they are, how they work, and why they are useful in real-time or batch data pipelines.

## 🪙 What is a Gold Table?

Gold Tables are the **final output tables** in the **Medallion Architecture**.

| Layer   | Purpose                         |
|---------|---------------------------------|
| Bronze  | Raw or raw-ingested data        |
| Silver  | Cleaned and enriched data       |
| 🪙 Gold   | Final, business-ready data       |

### ✅ Gold Table = Final layer used for:
- Dashboards (Power BI, Tableau)
- Reporting
- Machine Learning models
- External exports (to Snowflake, Redshift, Excel, etc.)

## ✅ What is a Materialized Table?

A **materialized table** means:

> It's a **real physical Delta table** stored with **precomputed results**, not a SQL view that runs logic every time.

You don’t calculate on the fly. You **run the logic once, store the output**, and then just **read the result quickly** anytime later.

---

## 🎯 Real-Life Example

You have a `silver_sales` table.  
You want to get total revenue by region and product category.

Instead of writing this SQL again and again:

```sql
SELECT region, category, SUM(revenue)
FROM silver_sales
GROUP BY region, category
```

You **materialize** it like this:

```python
gold_df = silver_df.groupBy("region", "category").agg(sum("revenue").alias("total_revenue"))

gold_df.write.format("delta") \
    .mode("overwrite") \
    .option("overwriteSchema", "true") \
    .saveAsTable("gold_sales_summary")
```

Now `gold_sales_summary` is a **Materialized Gold Table**:

* ✅ Precomputed
* ✅ Stored
* ✅ Fast to query
* ✅ Ready for BI tools

## 🧠 Why Use Materialized Tables?

| Benefit            | Why It’s Useful                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 Faster queries  | No need to re-run expensive joins/aggregations |
| 💵 Saves cost      | Less compute = cheaper in cloud                |
| 📊 Dashboard-ready | Ideal for Power BI, Tableau, Excel             |
| 🧩 Exportable      | Easily export to Redshift, Snowflake, etc.     |
| 🔐 Consistent data | Everyone sees the same snapshot                |

## 🆚 View vs Materialized Table

| Feature               | SQL View                    | Materialized Table          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Storage               | ❌ Not stored (virtual only) | ✅ Yes, stored in Delta      |
| Performance           | ❌ Recomputes every time     | ✅ Precomputed & Fast        |
| BI-friendly           | ❌ Slow on large data        | ✅ Ideal for dashboards      |
| Supports partitioning | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes                       |
| Refresh manually      | ❌ Auto (but slow)           | ✅ You control refresh logic |

## 🛠️ How to Create a Materialized Gold Table (Batch)

```python
silver_df = spark.read.table("silver_sales")

gold_df = silver_df.groupBy("region", "category") \
    .agg(sum("revenue").alias("total_revenue"))

gold_df.write.format("delta") \
    .mode("overwrite") \
    .saveAsTable("gold_sales_summary")
```

## 🔁 Refreshing a Gold Table

| Method    | How it Works                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Batch     | Daily/hourly using Jobs or Airflow |
| Streaming | Real-time updates via `MERGE`      |
| Manual    | Rerun notebook or workflow         |

---

## 🧱 Typical Pipeline: Bronze → Silver → Gold

```text
Bronze (raw) ➡ Silver (cleaned) ➡ Gold (aggregated/business-ready)
```

Example:

```text
Raw Orders ➡ Cleaned Transactions ➡ Daily Sales Summary
```

---

## 📌 Best Practices

* Build gold tables **from silver**, not from raw
* Use **partitioning** (e.g., by date or region) for performance
* Use **schema evolution** when writing
* Maintain **metadata and lineage** for auditability

## ✅ Summary

| Concept            | Explanation                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Gold Table         | Final business output table                |
| Materialized Table | Precomputed + physically stored in Delta   |
| Benefits           | Fast, cost-efficient, BI-ready             |
| How to build       | Read from silver → transform → write table |
| Best for           | Dashboards, ML, exports                    |
